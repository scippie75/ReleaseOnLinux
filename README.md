# ReleaseOnLinux
Steps on how to release an application on Linux without an IDE to help you with it

## Warning!
This guide is Work In Progress. Do not use! And even if it's finished... Do not use! Use only at your own risk.

## Getting started
First thing I did was install Ubuntu Linux because most games released on Steam/GOG/... will work on it and we will at least have this too.
